Analysis Scripts for "Transcript Characterization of mRNP-SiMPull"

The following directories contain scripts and key inputs used at various steps of the analysis as shown in ***Yra1 (Aly/REF) is a conserved organizer of nuclear mRNP architecture*** by Asada et al.

The directories are organized in the stepwise manner in which the files were processed:
		* 0. Preprocessing and STAR alignment
		* 1. DE analysis & Transcript Characterization
		* 2. Motif Discovery & Secondary Structure

***Snakemake and transcript characterization pipelines were initially written by Taylor Rieter and adapted from Bensidoun_et_al_2021***
